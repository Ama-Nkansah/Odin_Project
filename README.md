# The Odin Project Solutions

Welcome to my solutions for The Odin Project! This repository contains all the projects, coding challenges, and exercises I've worked on as part of the curriculum. The goal is to improve my skills in web development, problem-solving, and JavaScript, as well as to showcase my understanding of algorithms and data structures.

## Introduction
The Odin Project provides a comprehensive curriculum that covers full-stack web development, including front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), back-end technologies (Node.js, Express), and databases. Throughout this project, I’ve worked on various mini-projects and coding challenges that help solidify my understanding of the concepts.

## Projects Overview
Currently, I have the following folder in my Odin Project:

- **Problem Solving**: Located in the `Problem_Solving` folder. This folder contains coding challenges and algorithmic problems that I have solved using JavaScript. It’s a key section of my learning process as I work to improve my problem-solving skills.

Each problem in the `Problem_Solving` folder includes the code and comments where necessary to explain the approach taken. Feel free to check out the code for each challenge.

## Skills Acquired
Throughout this project, I have learned and practiced a variety of skills, including:
- **HTML/CSS**: Building static and responsive web pages.
- **JavaScript**: Writing algorithms, solving coding challenges, and manipulating DOM elements.
- **Git/GitHub**: Version control and collaboration.
- **Node.js/Express**: Setting up back-end servers and RESTful APIs (for future projects).
- **Problem Solving**: Approaching algorithmic challenges, breaking them down, and optimizing solutions.

## Future Goals
- Continue working on more challenging problems to improve algorithmic thinking.
- Build more advanced projects using full-stack technologies.
- Contribute to open-source projects to improve collaboration and experience with larger codebases.
- Learn frameworks like React and Express to enhance front-end and back-end development skills.
