## Introduction
In this section, I work through various problems from The Odin Project. The goal is to strengthen my coding skills by applying what I've learned so far. Each problem was solved using different techniques, such as loops, conditionals, and object manipulation.

## Problem Solving Approach
I tackle each problem step by step, starting with:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: Carefully read the problem statement and ensure I fully understand the requirements.
2. **Breaking Down the Problem**: Break the problem into smaller, manageable parts.
3. **Writing Pseudocode**: Draft pseudocode to plan my solution before jumping into code.
4. **Coding the Solution**: Implement the solution in JavaScript.
5. **Testing and Refining**: Test the code with various edge cases and refine it for efficiency.

## Problems Solved
- **Problem 1: Reverse a String**
  - [Solution](problem1.js)

- **Problem 2: Find the Largest Number**
  - [Solution](./solutions/problem2.js)

- **Problem 3: FizzBuzz Challenge**
  - [Solution](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository/blob/main/solutions/problem3.js#L12)

- **Problem 4: Palindrome Check**

## Future Goals
- Continue practicing problem-solving with a focus on more complex algorithms.
- Improve efficiency and optimize solutions as I encounter more challenging problems.
- Share solutions and insights to help others on their coding journey.
